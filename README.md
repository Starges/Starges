### Hi there 👋

🛠️ **VoIP Engineer | Asterisk & FreeSWITCH Developer** 

Currently breaking (and fixing) things with:

- 🛠️ **Core VoIP stack**: Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, Kamailio, Janus, WebRTC  
- 💻 **Backend tools**: PHP (Core & Laravel), Node.js, Python, and yes… still Perl  
- ⚛️ **Frontend adventures**: React, TypeScript  
- 📱 **Mobile experiments**: React Native (because who doesn’t like a little chaos?)

Loving the chaos of real-time media, smooth audio flows (most days) and behaving endpoints (eventually... of course)
